## STEVE workshop 2021

The workshop will (1) serve as a venue for developing observation strategies, experimental campaigns and associated observation modes to fill in both synoptic and event-based data gaps; (2) organize modeling efforts, guided by known phenomenological characteristics to date, to answer key community questions about the physical morphology and dynamics of STEVE.

The organizing committee is deeply grateful for US National Science Foundation funding that enables the STEVE workshop under grant AGS-2025481.
