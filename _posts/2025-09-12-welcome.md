## Third STEVE Community Workshop - October 16<sup>th</sup>-18<sup>th</sup>, 2025

The organizing committee would like to invite you to participate in the Third STEVE Community Workshop: Advancing Understanding of a New Atmospheric Phenomenon. The workshop will be hosted in a hybrid format with the in-person participation taking place at the [Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/). The preliminary agenda is now available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o5MhNlex93z0ZUOygFVPCbrQmhqaGbvY/view).

The [organizing committee](https://steve-aurora.github.io/about/) is deeply grateful for US National Science Foundation funding that enables the STEVE workshop under grant AGS-2025481.


## Workshop Goals

As you are well aware, STEVE has passed beyond an initial discovery period and is now recognized as a bona fide geophysical phenomenon with numerous observational sightings and recent enlightening studies. The purpose of this workshop is to maintain community momentum on STEVE research.  Observational and theoretical geospace scientists and stakeholders will gather to disseminate STEVE research findings, identify outstanding questions about the phenomenon, and to continue formulation of future research plans and collaborative studies on the topic.

## Workshop Logistics

The meeting begins on October 16<sup>th</sup> and the agenda includes special activities this year - a tour of the Poker Flat Research Range followed by aurora chasing that evening. Transportation has been arranged by the organizing committee for everyone who expressed interest to participate in the survey. Easy grab-and-go dinner for all participants will be arranged, and we recommend that guests bring something similar as well. Dr. Don Hampton will provide a guided tour of the facilities at the [Poker Flat Research Range](https://www.pfrr.alaska.edu/).

Please prepare for Alaska in October if you plan to participate in the aurora chasing activity. While October is not the coldest time of the year, it is still expected to be quite cold with temperature typically ranging between 18 and 35 Fahrenheit. Please bring warm clothing, gloves, and anything you might need for comfort. Pack a camera if you have one, and consider bringing extra snacks (weâ€™ll have some available, but feel free to bring your favorites).
